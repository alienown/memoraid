You are an experienced product manager tasked with creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the descriptions below:

<project_description>
{{project-description}} <- insert the MVP idea
</project_description>

<project_details>
{{project-details}} <- insert summary of the planning session
</project_details>

Follow these steps to create a comprehensive and well-organized document:

1. Divide the PRD into the following sections:
a. Project Overview
b. User Problem
c. Functional Requirements
d. Project Boundaries
e. User Stories
f. Success Metrics

2. In each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the project description and answers to clarifying questions. Ensure that:
- You use clear and concise language.
- You include specific details and data where necessary.
- You maintain consistency throughout the document.
- You address all points listed in each section.

3. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria:
- List ALL necessary user stories, including basic, alternative, and edge-case scenarios.
- Assign a unique requirement ID (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability.
- Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrictions.
- Ensure no potential user interaction is omitted.
- Ensure each user story is testable.

Use the following structure for each user story:
- ID
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria

4. After completing the PRD, review it against this checklist:
- Can each user story be tested?
- Are the acceptance criteria clear and specific?
- Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application?
- Have we included authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

5. PRD Formatting:
- Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
- Do not use bold formatting in markdown (**).
- List ALL user stories.
- Format the PRD in proper markdown.

Prepare the PRD using the following structure:
```markdown
# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - {{app-name}}
## 1. Product Overview
## 2. User Problem
## 3. Functional Requirements
## 4. Product Boundaries
## 5. User Stories
## 6. Success Metrics
```

Be sure to fill out each section with detailed, relevant information based on the project description and our clarifying questions.
Make sure the PRD is comprehensive, clear, and includes all the relevant information needed to continue working on the product.
