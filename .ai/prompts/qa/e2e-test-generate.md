Analyse {#e2e-test-plan.md} and generate e2e tests for the following user story.

<user-story>
{userStory}
</user-story>

Use the page object models located in `src/app/e2e/page-object-models` to structure your tests. Focus on the key functionalities and user flows described in the user story. 

Ensure that your tests are clear, concise, and follow best practices for end-to-end testing. Use Playwright's capabilities to interact with the application as a user would, verifying that the expected outcomes occur.

Test only the core functionalities relevant to the user story, avoiding unnecessary complexity. The goal is to ensure that the main user flows work as intended without exhaustive edge-case coverage.
