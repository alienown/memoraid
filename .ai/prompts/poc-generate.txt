High-Level Description:
Develop a simplified proof-of-concept (POC) for Memoraidâ€”a web-based flashcard platform. This POC will focus on the AI-Generated Flashcards feature, allowing users to paste text and automatically generate flashcards directly from the frontend.

Key Feature for the POC:
- Implement the AI flashcard generation functionality that allows users to paste text and receive flashcards with a "Front" (max 500 characters) and "Back" (max 200 characters) generated using OpenAI.

Tech Stack for the Key Feature:
- Frontend: React with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/ui for building the UI.
- AI Integration: OpenAI SDK using a provided API key from environment variables.

Requirements for the POC:
1. Build a simple interface where a user can input or paste text.
2. Integrate directly with the OpenAI API (using an API key from environment variables) to generate flashcards.
3. Display the generated flashcards, where each flashcard includes a "Front" and a "Back".

Provide a detailed plan for creating POC and ask for confirmation before proceeding with the implementation.
