You are an AI assistant tasked with summarizing a conversation about planning the UI architecture for an MVP and preparing a concise summary for the next stage of development. In the conversation history, you will find the following information:
1. Product requirements document (PRD)
2. Tech stack information
3. API roadmap
4. Conversation history containing questions and answers
5. UI architecture recommendations

Your task is to:
1. Summarize the conversation history, focusing on all decisions related to planning the UI architecture.
2. Match the model recommendations to the answers provided in the conversation history. Identify which recommendations are relevant based on the discussion.
3. Prepare a detailed conversation summary that includes:
a. Key UI architecture requirements
b. Key views, screens, and user flows
c. API integration and state management strategy
d. Responsiveness, accessibility, and security concerns
e. Any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification
4. Format the results as follows:

<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
[List the decisions made by the user, numbered].
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
[List of the most important recommendations matched to the conversation, numbered]
</matched_recommendations>

<ui_architecture_planning_summary>
[Provide a detailed conversation summary, including the items listed in Step 3].
</ui_architecture_planning_summary>

<unresolved_issues>
[List any unresolved issues or areas requiring further clarification, if any]
</unresolved_issues>

The final output should contain only markdown content. Make sure your summary is clear, concise, and provides valuable information for the next stage of UI architecture planning and API integration.
