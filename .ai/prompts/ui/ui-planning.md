You are an AI assistant tasked with helping to plan the UI architecture for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the information provided. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create a detailed UI architecture, user journey maps, and navigation structure.

Please read the following information carefully:

<product_requirements>
#prd.md
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
#tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

<api_plan>
#api-plan.md
</api_plan>

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to UI design. Consider the following:

1. Identify key views and screens based on product requirements and available API endpoints.
2. Define potential user flows and navigation between views, taking into account API capabilities.
3. Consider the UI components and interaction patterns that may be necessary to communicate effectively with the API.
4. Think about the responsiveness and accessibility of the interface.
5. Evaluate security and authentication requirements in the context of API integration.
6. Consider any specific UI libraries or frameworks that may be beneficial to the project.
7. Analyze how the API structure affects the UI design and data flows in the application.

Based on your analysis, generate a list of questions and recommendations. These should address any ambiguities, potential problems, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective UI architecture. Consider questions about:

1. Hierarchy and organization of views in relation to API structure
2. User flows and navigation supported by accessible endpoints
3. Responsiveness and adaptation to different devices
4. Accessibility and inclusiveness
5. Security and authorization at the UI level in relation to API mechanisms
6. Consistency of design and user experience
7. Strategy for managing application state and synchronization with API
8. Handling error states and exceptions returned by API
9. Caching and performance optimization strategies for API communication

The output should be structured as follows:

<ui_architecture_planning_output>
<questions>
[List your questions here, numbered]
</questions>

<recommendations>
[List your recommendations here, numbered]
</recommendations>

Remember, your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations, that will help you create a solid UI architecture for your MVP, fully integrated with available API endpoints. Focus on the clarity, relevance, and accuracy of your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the context provided and the user's answers, until there are no more questions and recommendations or user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on the clarity, relevance, and accuracy of your results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.
