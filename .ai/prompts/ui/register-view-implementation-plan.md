# View Implementation Plan: Register View

## 1. Overview
Implement a registration view as a single file component (`Registration`) that enables new users to sign up with their email and password. The view validates inputs inline, provides accessible labels, securely submits data via HTTPS, and displays toast notifications for success or error feedback.

## 2. View Routing
- Path: `/register`
- Accessible via the application’s routing configuration using React Router’s `createBrowserRouter`.

## 3. Component Structure
- Registration: The sole component that encapsulates the entire registration view, including:
  - Input fields for email and password.
  - Inline validations.
  - Submit button to trigger registration.
  - Toast notifications for displaying success or error messages.

## 4. Component Details

### Registration
- **Component Description:** A single file component that handles the entire registration process. It manages form state, validation, API communication, and notifications.
- **Main Elements:** 
  - HTML `<form>` containing:
    - Email input field with label.
    - Password input field with label.
    - Submit button.
  - Inline error messages below each input.
  - Toast notification area for displaying messages.
- **Supported Interactions:** 
  - onChange events for input fields.
  - onSubmit event for triggering the registration API call.
- **Supported Validation:**
  - Email: Required and must match valid email format.
  - Password: Required.
- **Types:** None, each field is managed in separate state variables.
- **Props:** No external props; state is managed internally.

### Sonner (Toast)
- **Component Description:** A third-party library for displaying toast notifications.
- **Example usage:**: 
  - toast.success(`Generated ${flashcards.length} flashcards successfully!`);
  - toast.error("Failed to connect to the server. Please try again later.");

## 5. Types
- **API Request/Response Types:**
  - Request: Should match the backend's `RegisterUserRequest` DTO.
  - Response: `Response` type - { isSuccess: boolean; errors: Error[]; }

## 6. State Management
- Use React’s `useState` hook to manage form state:
  - State variables: `email`, `password`, `errors`, `isSubmitting`.
- Optionally encapsulate form logic in custom hooks, though not required with a single component.

## 7. API Integration
- **Endpoint:** POST `/users/register`
- **Integration Details:** 
  - Utilize the API client from `api.ts` (e.g., `api.users.registerUser`).
  - Prepare a request with `{ email, password }`.
  - On success, display a success toast and optionally navigate to login view (`/login` view will be implemented later).
  - On error, update field errors and show an error toast.

## 8. User Interactions
- **On Form Submission:**
  - Block multiple submissions by disabling the submit button.
  - Perform API call and display toast notifications based on outcome.
- **On Success:** Show a success message and redirect the user to `/login` view which will be implemented later.
- **On Error:** Display relevant error messages inline and via toast.

## 9. Conditions and Validation
- **Email Field:**
  - Must be non-empty and comply with a valid email regex.
- **Password Field:**
  - Must be non-empty.
- **Form Submission:** Both fields must pass validation before initiating the API call.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all input fields have associated labels and error messages are screen-reader accessible.

## 10. Handling Errors
- **Field-Level Errors:** Managed inline below each input.
- **API Errors:** On receiving error responses show a toast notification.
- **Network Failures:** Present a general toast error message if the API call fails.

## 11. Implementation steps
1. Update the routing configuration to serve the `Registration` component at `/register`.
2. Create the single file component `Registration` with a consolidated implementation.
3. Implement state management using React hooks for email, password, errors, and isSubmitting.
4. Build the form structure with email and password inputs, submit button, and inline error displays.
5. Add inline validation logic triggered on form submission.
6. Integrate the API call using the client provided in `api.ts` for registering a new user.
7. Implement toast notifications to inform the user of success or failure.
