    1. All views (Registration, User Panel, Generate Flashcards, My Flashcards, Study) will be top-level routes with no nested hierarchy, sharing a common layout with a sticky top navigation bar.
    2. If the user is unathenticated, they will be redirected to the Login view. If authenticated, they will be redirected to the Generate Flashcards view.
    3. The navigation bar will remain always visible, with protected links currently displayed until authentication is implemented.
    4. The flashcard generation view will include inline "Accept" and "Reject" buttons with an "Edit" button triggering a centered modal (using shadcn Dialog) that contains an explicit close button.
    5. Form validations will display red, bold error messages directly below the respective fields.
    6. The flashcards list view will support pagination with items per page, next/previous page controls, page numbers, and a simple integer total count.
    7. Each action triggering an API call will include a loading indicator integrated within buttons or forms, disabling only the relevant part (usually the button that triggered the action) when multiple submissions are allowed or the whole form for single-use scenarios.
    8. Global notifications will be displayed using the Sonner Toast component positioned at the top right, auto-dismissing after a few seconds.
    9. API integration and state handling will be managed using React’s useState hook and Context API, with the http client generated from the OpenAPI document, avoiding additional caching libraries.
    10. Styling will rely on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for basic responsiveness and accessibility, with minimal theming (base neutral color) for the MVP.
  </decisions>
  <matched_recommendations>
    1. The recommendation to use a universal layout with a sticky top navigation bar and top-level routing has been confirmed.
    2. The plan to standardize UI components using shadcn/ui (including Input, Button, Card, Dialog, Sonner Toast, and Form) aligns with the discussion.
    3. Implementing inline buttons for Accept, Reject, and Edit in the flashcard generation view with an explicit close button in the modal matches the user’s decision.
    4. The approach of using Tailwind CSS for padding and layout, along with Sonner for toast notifications, is adopted.
    5. Managing API call states with useState/Context and integrating loading indicators within action buttons or forms concur with the discussed strategy.

  <ui_architecture_planning_summary>
    The conversation established a clear UI architecture that mandates a universal layout with a sticky navigation bar at the top. All views are implemented as top-level routes, encompassing:
    - Registration and Login (public)
    - User Panel, Generate Flashcards, My Flashcards, and Study (protected, though currently accessible to all users until authentication is implemented).

    If the user is unathenticated, they will be redirected to the Login view. If authenticated, they will be redirected to the Generate Flashcards view.
    The Generate Flashcards view will allow users to paste text, and generate flashcards which can be inline accepted or rejected.
    An Edit button on each flashcard opens a centered modal for modifications. The "Save flashcards" button will trigger the API call only for accepted flashcards.
    For the My Flashcards view, a paginated list will display flashcards along with controls for navigation and an integer total count below it. Each flashcard in the list can be edited or deleted, with a confirmation dialog for deletions. Additional sutton for manual flashcard creation will be available (button opens a modal with form). 
    API integration will be achieved using a generated HTTP client, with API state handled via React’s useState and Context API.
    Error messages are shown as red, bold text under form fields, while global notifications and error toasts are managed by wrapping the Sonner Toast component.
    Responsiveness and accessibility will be ensured by leveraging Tailwind’s spacing utilities and shadcn components, which provide out-of-the-box responsive and accessible UI elements, without additional special theming for the MVP.
