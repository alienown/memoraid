### Main Problem
Manually creating high-quality educational flashcards is time-consuming, which discourages the use of an effective learning method like spaced repetition.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- AI-generated flashcards based on input text (copy-paste functionality)
- Manual creation of flashcards
- Viewing, editing, and deleting flashcards
- A simple user account system for storing flashcards
- Integration of flashcards with a ready-made, open-source repetition algorithm

### What is NOT Included in the MVP
- A custom, advanced repetition algorithm (like SuperMemo, Anki)
- Importing multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Sharing flashcard sets between users
- Integration with other educational platforms
- Mobile applications (initially web-only)

### Success Criteria
- 75% of flashcards generated by AI are accepted by users
- Users create 75% of their flashcards using AI
