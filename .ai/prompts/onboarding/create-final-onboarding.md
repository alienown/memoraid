There are two onboarding documents available for this project:

1. #file:onboarding.md – generated solely from the project's Git history.
2. #file:onboarding.md – created primarily by analyzing the current project structure.

While these documents contain some overlapping content, each also includes unique insights. Your task is to carefully review both files, identify their respective strengths, and consolidate the key information into a single, comprehensive onboarding document.

The final document should:
1. Include all relevant and non-duplicative information from both sources.
2. Incorporate any content that appears in one file but is not present in the other.
3. Provide a complete and coherent overview that helps new developers quickly understand the project’s purpose, structure, history, and development practices.
4. Resolve inconsistencies and eliminate redundancy where necessary.

Save the final, merged onboarding file to the following path: .ai/onboarding/onboarding.md.
