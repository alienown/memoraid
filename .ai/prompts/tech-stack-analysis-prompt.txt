I'm taking part in a course and I will develop a project. The product requirements description is in the file #prd.md. I need to analyze whether my tech stack is suitable for the project.
The course authors have provided a tech stack that they recommend for the project. However I have my own tech stack that I would like to use.
Perform a critical but objective analysis of whether the my-tech-stack adequately addresses the needs of #prd.md.
Compare the two tech stacks and provide a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of each stack in relation to the project requirements.

Consider the following questions:

1. Will the technology allow us to quickly deliver an MVP?
2. Will the solution be scalable as the project grows?
3. Will the maintenance and development costs be acceptable?
4. Do we really need such a complex solution?
5. Is there a simpler approach that meets our requirements?
6. Will the technology allow us to ensure adequate security?
