# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: DELETE /users

## 1. Endpoint Overview
Secure account deletion endpoint that removes all user data (flashcards, etc.).

## 2. Request Details
- **HTTP Method:** DELETE  
- **URL Structure:** /users  
- **Parameters:** None
- **Request Body** None

## 3. Types Used
- **Request Class:** None
- **Response Class:** Response (non-generic)

## 4. Data Flow
1. API receives the DELETE /users request.
2. The API layer calls UserService.DeleteUserAsync.
3. UserService validates the request via FluentValidation.
4. Service deletes user data in the database.
5. The response is returned with a 200 OK for success, or an error response for any issues.

## 5. Security Considerations
- Enforce HTTPS to protect sensitive data.
- Validate the user identity before deletion.

## 6. Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request:** For syntactic or formatting errors.
- **401 Unauthorized:** If the user is unauthenticated.

## 7. Performance Considerations
- Utilize asynchronous processing in the service method.
- Minimize database interactions as account deletion is a low-frequency operation.
- Ensure proper EF Core query optimizations.

## 8. Implementation Steps
1. Implement UserService.DeleteUserAsync to perform the delete operation in the database.
2. Expose the DELETE /users endpoint in the minimal API configuration to call UserService.DeleteUserAsync.
3. Make sure the endpoint is correctly annotated like other endpoints for Open API documentation.

## Last key points
- There is no need to create tests for this endpoint for now. It will be manually tested. We will automate it later.
