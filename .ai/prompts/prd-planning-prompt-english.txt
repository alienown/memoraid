You are an experienced product manager tasked with helping to create a comprehensive design requirements document (PRD) based on the information provided.
Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create the full PRD.

Please read the following information carefully:

<project_description>
{{project-highlevel}} <- copy the high-level description of the project
</project_description>

Analyze the provided information, focusing on aspects relevant to creating a PRD. Consider the following issues:

1. Identify the main problem the product aims to solve.
2. Define the key functionalities of the MVP.
3. Consider potential user stories and product usage paths.
4. Think about success criteria and ways to measure them.
5. Assess project constraints and their impact on product development.

Based on the analysis, generate a list of questions and recommendations. These should address any ambiguities, potential problems, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions about:

1. Details of the user problem
2. Prioritization of functionalities
3. Expected user experience
4. Measurable success indicators
5. Potential risks and challenges
6. Timeline and resources

The output from the first round should have the following structure:

<prd_planning_output>
<questions_round_1>
[List your questions here, numbered]
</questions_round_1>

<recommendations_round_1>
[List your recommendations here, numbered]
</recommendations_round_1>
</prd_planning_output>

Ask questions and generate recommendations until you have a comprehensive understanding of the project.
When everything is clear and you have enough information, indicate that you are ready to proceed with the next steps.
