You are an experienced programmer tasked with creating a README.md file for a GitHub project. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, well-organized README that adheres to best practices and includes all relevant information from the provided project files.

Here are the files you need to analyze:

<prd>
  #prd.md
</prd>

<tech_stack>
  #tech_stack.md
</tech_stack>

<dependencies>
  <backend>
    #Directory.Packages.props
  </backend>

  <frontend>
    #package.json
  </frontend>
</dependencies>

Here is the structure of the README.md file you need to create:

1. Project name
2. Project description
3. Tech stack
4. Getting started locally
5. Available scripts
6. Project scope
7. Project status
8. License

Instructions:
1. Carefully read all the provided project files.
2. Extract relevant information for each section of the README.
3. Organize the information into the specified structure.
4. Ensure you follow these GitHub README best practices:
   - Use clear and concise language.
   - Include a table of contents for longer READMEs.
   - Use appropriate Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.).
   - Provide clear instructions for setting up and running the project.
   - Include badges where relevant (e.g., build status, version, license).
   - Link to additional documentation if available.
5. Thoroughly check that you have included all essential information from the input files.

Before writing the final README, wrap your analysis inside <readme_planning> tags in a thought block. In this section:
- List key information from each input file separately (PRD, tech stack, dependencies).
- Create a brief outline for each README section.
- Note any missing information that may be needed for a comprehensive README.

This process will help ensure an accurate and well-organized README.

After completing the analysis, provide the full content of README.md in Markdown format.

Remember to strictly follow the given structure and include all contextual information from the provided files. Your goal is to create a README that not only adheres to the specified format but also delivers exhaustive and useful information to anyone accessing the project's repository.

The final output is solely the creation of the README.md file in the project's root, in Markdown format in English, and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the readme_planning section.
