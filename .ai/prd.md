# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Memoraid

## 1. Product Overview
Memoraid is a web-based flashcard platform designed to simplify and accelerate the creation of high-quality educational flashcards. The application leverages AI to automatically generate flashcards from user-supplied text using a dedicated AI-generation view while providing a separate "My Flashcards" view for manual creation, review, editing, and deleting. The system also includes user account management and integrates with an existing spaced repetition algorithm for effective study sessions.

## 2. User Problem
Creating educational flashcards manually is a time-consuming process. Users who wish to benefit from spaced repetition are often discouraged by the effort required to manually produce high-quality flashcards. Memoraid addresses this pain point by automating a large portion of the flashcard creation process while still providing the flexibility for manual input and corrections.

## 3. Functional Requirements
1. AI-Generated Flashcards
   - Provide a dedicated view where authenticated users can copy-paste large blocks of text (maximum 10000 characters).
   - Automatically generate flashcards from the text. Each flashcard comprises two fields:
     - Front: Required, maximum 500 characters.
     - Back: Required, maximum 200 characters.
   - Present generated flashcards in an AI-generation review interface with options to accept, reject, or modify (via an edit modal).

2. Manual Flashcard Creation and CRUD Operations
   - Provide a separate "My Flashcards" view for authenticated users to view and manage their flashcards.
   - Allow users to create, view, edit, and delete flashcards they own.
   - Enforce validation rules (fields required and character limits) on both the frontend and backend.

3. User Account Management
   - Implement email and password registration and login.
   - Enable password changes (requires entry of the current password).
   - Provide secure account deletion that includes reauthentication and a confirmation prompt.

4. Study Mode Integration
   - Integrate the flashcards with an external spaced repetition algorithm.
   - Present flashcards in study mode by showing only the "Front" and revealing the "Back‚Äù upon user interaction.
   - Allow users to rate how well they remembered the answer to adjust future study sessions.

5. Data Logging for Analytics
   - Track metrics such as:
     - The percentage of AI-generated flashcards accepted by users.
     - The percentage of total flashcards created using AI.
   - Store these logs in a database for ongoing performance and usage analysis.

6. Authentication and Authorization
   - All flashcard functionalities (AI-generation and CRUD operations) are available only to authenticated users.
   - Users can only view, edit, or delete flashcards that they own.
